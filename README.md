# Welcome to GitHub Desktop!

This is your README. READMEs are where you can communicate what your project is and how to use it.

Write your name on line 6, save it, and then head back to GitHub Desktop.

GitHub on the desktop provides an advantage over just using the web version becasue it allows for a direct connection to writing code. This allows for easy access to sharing and modifying code in a streamlined connected system rather than copying back and forth across multiple different softwares.

The gitHub repository system allows multiple collaborators to work on a singular code separately: changing, committing, tracking and reverting code in an organized cloud.
